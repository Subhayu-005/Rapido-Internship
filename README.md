Strategy & Operations Intern | Rapido (Bike Taxi & Mobility Platform)
Author: Subhayu Paul, IIT Kharagpur

👋 Project Overview

During my internship at Rapido, I worked on a multi-dimensional project to understand why captains leave the platform and what truly drives long-term loyalty.
The work combined research, data analysis, product thinking, and field insights to design a practical retention roadmap for the company.

My goal was simple:
Decode captain behaviour → Find gaps → Build solutions that improve earnings, fairness, and belonging.

🎯 What I Actually Did 
1. Understanding Attrition & Retention Drivers

Conducted a full diagnostic on why captains churn — from low earnings visibility to cancellation friction and lack of fare control.

Identified both financial and psychological factors that influence captain switching behaviour.

Built a retention model combining financial incentives + non-monetary motivators.

2. Expectation Mapping & Captain Persona Building

Surveyed and interviewed 100+ captains (active + former) across cities.

Created captain personas with demographic, economic, and behavioural insights.

Mapped expectations like income consistency, app support, flexibility, recognition, and fairness.

Analysed expense patterns to understand how weekly earnings translate into real-life needs.

3. Competitive Benchmarking (Uber, Ola, inDrive, Gojek)

Benchmarked UX flows, payout systems, incentives, support channels, and onboarding.

Identified product gaps and experience differences driving captain migration.

Built a structured comparison of driver benefits and engagement programs.

4. Incentive & Benefit Design

Designed a time-based incentive model projected to:

Reduce churn by ~18%

Increase online time by ~22%

Proposed 10+ captain-facing features including:

Real-time Earnings Dashboard

Cancellation Fairness Tracker

Ride Profitability Filters

“Captain’s Voice” feedback system

Created a micro-insurance model priced at ₹125–₹708/month with shared contributions.

Designed a vehicle rental ecosystem for captains without vehicles.

5. Non-Monetary Engagement & Culture

Designed a loyalty program with badges, tenure milestones, and service recognition.

Proposed Captain Clubs and digital communities for grievance support and peer bonding.

Crafted community frameworks to build trust, belonging, and pride.

6. Rural Outreach & Inclusion Strategy

Mapped opportunities for rural onboarding via government schemes & SHGs.

Recommended collaborations with NGOs and mobility access programs.

Analysed 50+ NGOs for women-in-mobility initiatives.

7. Women in Mobility — Pink Bike Initiative

Conducted a structured study of women’s safety, mobility access, financial barriers.

Proposed a roadmap to grow women captains and strengthen the Pink Bike brand narrative.

8. Partnership Strategy (OEMs, Dealers, Finance)

Mapped OEM and dealer networks for city-wise partnerships.

Designed co-branded financing and servicing models to reduce onboarding friction.

Built a 100-day phased rollout plan integrating incentives, insurance, community, and partnerships.

9. Brand & Influencer Strategy

Curated a list of leading travel vloggers & mobility storytellers.

Proposed campaigns to humanise captain journeys and elevate brand perception.

10. Delivery & Leadership Communication

Consolidated insights into leadership-ready decks with measurable KPIs.

Ensured recommendations were aligned with operational, product, and tech feasibility.

Maintained end-to-end linkage from research → insight → solution → business impact.
